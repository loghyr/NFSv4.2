Abstract

   [[anchor1: This template is for authors of IETF specifications
   containing MIB modules.  This template can be used as a starting
   point to produce specifications that comply with the Operations &
   Management Area guidelines for MIB module internet drafts.
   Throughout the template, the marker "[TEMPLATE TODO]" is used as a
   placeholder to indicate an element or text that requires replacement
   or removal.  All the places with [TEMPLATE TODO] markers should be
   replaced or removed before the document is submitted.]]

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines
   objects for managing [TEMPLATE TODO].

   [[anchor2: [TEMPLATE TODO]: describe what functionality will be
   managed using this MIB module.  It can be good to mention the
   protocol being managed, and whether there is a particular aspect of
   the protocol to be managed, or a particular goal of the module.  But
   keep it brief.  Remember, don't put any citations in the abstract,
   and expand your acronyms.]]

Foreword to template users

   This template is intended to help authors write the surrounding text
   needed in a MIB module internet draft, but does not provide a
   template for writing the MIB module itself.

   Throughout this template, the marker "[TEMPLATE TODO]" is used as a
   reminder to the template user to indicate an element or text that
   requires replacement or removal by the template user before
   submission to the internet draft editor.  All [TEMPLATE TODO] markers
   should be resolved and removed before you submit your document to the
   internet-draft editor.

   For updated information on MIB module guidelines and templates, see
   [RFC4181] and the OPS Area web page and wiki.

   For information on writing internet drafts or RFCs, see
   http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-guidelines.txt and RFC2223(bis)
   [RFC2223], and look at http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html for
   issues to note when writing drafts.

   This template is not meant to be a complete list of everything needed
   to write MIB module internet drafts, but to summarize the often-
   needed basic features to get a document containing a MIB module
   started.  An important purpose of the template is to aid authors in
   developing an internet draft that is laid out in a manner consistent
   with other internet drafts containing MIB modules.  Internet drafts
   submitted for advancement to the standards track typically require
   review by a MIB Doctor.  This template standardizes the layout and
   naming of sections, includes the appropriate boilerplate text, and
   facilitates the development of tools to automate the checking of MIB
   module internet drafts, to speed the WG and IESG review processes.

   An XML2RFC template is also available.  For information on XML2RFC,
   see RFC2629 [RFC2629], and documentation available at
   http://xml.resource.org.  The XML2RFC version includes advice
   describing how to fill in each section of the template.  XML2RFC
   generates the actual internet-draft from your information, and
   automatically handles getting up-to-date boilerplates, references,
   and it handles many idnits issues.

1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines
   objects for managing the [TEMPLATE TODO].

   [[anchor4: [TEMPLATE TODO]: describe what functionality will be
   managed using this MIB module.  Include citations for protocol
   specifications, architectures, related MIB modules, and protocol-
   specific management requirements.  Provide an overview of why a MIB
   module is appropriate for this protocol, whether there is a
   particular aspect of the protocol to be managed, and how the module
   is expected to be used to achieve particular goals.  Highlight
   anything 'different' about the module.  For example, a read-only MIB
   module.]]

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   [[anchor6: The title and text for this section has been copied from
   the official boilerplate, and should not be modified unless the
   official boilerplate text from the OPS Area web site has changed.
   See RFC4818 section 3.1 for a discussion of the boilerplate
   section.]]

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   [[anchor8: [TEMPLATE TODO] This boilerplate should be used if the
   RFC2119 key words are used in the internet draft.  The text in this
   section has been copied from the official boilerplate, and should not
   be modified.]]

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   [[anchor10: [TEMPLATE TODO] The narrative part should include an
   overview section that describes the scope and field of application of
   the MIB modules defined by the specification.  See RFC4181 section
   3.2 for a discussion of the Narrative section.]]

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   [[anchor12: [TEMPLATE TODO] The narrative part SHOULD include one or
   more sections to briefly describe the structure of the MIB modules
   defined in the specification.]]

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   [[anchor14: [TEMPLATE TODO] describe the textual conventions defined
   in the MIB module, and their purpose.  It may be helpful to highlight
   any textual conventions imported from partner documents.  Generic and
   Common Textual Conventions can be found summarized at the OPS Area
   web site.  If there are no textual conventions used in your MIB
   module, this section should be removed.]]

5.2.  The [TEMPLATE TODO] Subtree

   [[anchor16: [TEMPLATE TODO] copy this section for each subtree in the
   MIB module, and describe the purpose of the subtree.  For example,
   "The fooStats subtree provides information for identifying fault
   conditions and performance degradation of the foo functionality."]]

5.3.  The Notifications Subtree

   [[anchor18: [TEMPLATE TODO] describe the notifications defined in the
   MIB module, and their purpose.  Include a discussion of congestion
   control.  You might want to discuss throttling as well.  See
   RFC2914.]]

5.4.  The Table Structures

   [[anchor20: [TEMPLATE TODO] Describe the tables in the MIB module,
   their purpose, and their reltionship to each other.  If the row in
   one table is related to a row in another table, what happens when one
   of the rows is deleted?  Should the related row be deleted as well?
   Consider both directions.]]

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   [[anchor22: [TEMPLATE TODO]: The narrative part should include a
   section that specifies the relationship (if any) of the MIB modules



Name                    Expires October 10, 2008                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        Your MIB Module document name           April 2008


   contained in this internet drafts to other standards, particularly to
   standards containing other MIB modules.  If the MIB modules defined
   by the specification import definitions from other MIB modules or are
   always implemented in conjunction with other MIB modules, then those
   facts should be noted in the narrataive section, as should any
   special interpretations of objects in other MIB modules.  Note that
   citations may NOT be put into the MIB module portions of the internet
   draft, but documents used for Imported items are Normative
   references, so the citations should exist in the narrative section of
   the internet draft.  The preferred way to fill in a REFERENCE clause
   in a MIB module is of the form: "Guidelines for Writing an IANA
   Considerations Section in RFCs", RFC2434, section 2.3.]]

6.1.  Relationship to the [TEMPLATE TODO] MIB

   [[anchor24: Example: The Interface MIB [RFC2863] requires that any
   MIB module which is an adjunct of the Interface MIB clarify specific
   areas within the Interface MIB.  These areas were intentionally left
   vague in the Interface MIB to avoid over-constraining the MIB,
   thereby precluding management of certain media-types.  Section 4 of
   [RFC2863] enumerates several areas which a media-specific MIB must
   clarify.  The implementor is referred to [RFC2863] in order to
   understand the general intent of these areas.]]

6.2.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   [[anchor26: [TEMPLATE TODO]: Citations are not permitted within a MIB
   module, but any module mentioned in an IMPORTS clause or document
   mentioned in a REFERENCE clause is a Normative reference, and must be
   cited someplace within the narrative sections.  If there are imported
   items in the MIB module, such as Textual Conventions, that are not
   already cited, they can be cited in text here.  Since relationships
   to other MIB modules should be described in the narrative text, this
   section is typically used to cite modules from which Textual
   Conventions are imported.  Example: "The following MIB module IMPORTS
   objects from SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF
   [RFC2580], and IF-MIB [RFC2863]."]]

7.  Definitions

   [[anchor28: This section contains the actual MIB module(s).  These
   MIB modules MUST be written in SMIv2 [RFC2578] [RFC2579] [RFC2580].
   See Section 4 of RFC 4181 for guidelines on SMIv2 usage.  See
   Appendix C of RFC 4181 for suggested naming conventions.]]

   [TEMPLATE TODO]: put your valid MIB module here.
   A list of tools that can help automate the process of
   checking MIB definitions can be found at the OPS

   Area web site.

8.  Security Considerations

   [[anchor30: [TEMPLATE TODO] Each internet draft that defines one or
   more MIB modules MUST contain a section that discusses security
   considerations relevant to those modules.  This section MUST be
   patterned after the latest approved template (available at the OPS
   Area web site).]]

   [[anchor31: [TEMPLATE TODO] if you have any read-write and/or read-
   create objects, please include the following boilerplate paragraph,
   and list.the objects and their sensitivity.]]

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o

   [[anchor32: [TEMPLATE TODO] else if there are no read-write or read-
   create objects in your MIB module, use the following boilerplate
   paragraph.]]

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   [[anchor33: For all MIB modules you must evaluate whether any
   readable objects are sensitive or vulnerable (for instance, if they
   might reveal customer information or violate personal privacy laws
   such as those of the European Union if exposed to unathorized
   parties).  If so, please include the following boilerplate
   paragraph.]]

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:



Name                    Expires October 10, 2008                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        Your MIB Module document name           April 2008


   o

   o  [[anchor34: [TEMPLATE TODO] you should explicitly list by name any
      readable objects that are sensitive or vulnerable and the
      associated security risks should be spelled out (for instance, if
      they might reveal customer information or violate personal privacy
      laws such as those of the European Union if exposed to unathorized
      parties).]]

   [[anchor35: [TEMPLATE TODO] The following three boilerplate
   paragraphs should not be changed without very good reason.  Changes
   will almost certainly require justification during IESG review.]]

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   [[anchor37: [TEMPLATE TODO] In order to comply with IESG policy as
   set forth in http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-
   Draft that is submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an
   IANA Considerations section.  The requirements for this section vary
   depending what actions are required of the IANA.  See "Guidelines for
   Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs" [RFC2434]. and see
   RFC4181 section 3.5 for more information on writing an IANA clause
   for a MIB module internet draft.]]

   Option #1:







Name                    Expires October 10, 2008                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        Your MIB Module document name           April 2008


        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------
        sampleMIB         { mib-2 XXX }

   Option #2:

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

   Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, an internet
   draft MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual
   numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done
   in an internet draft MIB module.

   Option #3:

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   Intellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be claimed to
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in
   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights
   might or might not be available; nor does it represent that it has
   made any independent effort to identify any such rights.  Information
   on the procedures with respect to rights in RFC documents can be
   found in BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Copies of IPR disclosures made to the IETF Secretariat and any
   assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an
   attempt made to obtain a general license or permission for the use of
   such proprietary rights by implementers or users of this
   specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line IPR repository at
   http://www.ietf.org/ipr.

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary
   rights that may cover technology that may be required to implement
   this standard.  Please address the information to the IETF at
