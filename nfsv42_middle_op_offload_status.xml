    <t>
      OFFLOAD_STATUS is used for both intra-server and inter-server
      asynchronous copies. The OFFLOAD_STATUS operation allows the
      client to poll the destination server to determine the status
      of an asynchronous copy operation.
    </t>

    <t>
      If this operation is successful, the number of bytes copied
      are returned to the client in the osr_bytes_copied field. The
      osr_bytes_copied value indicates the number of bytes copied
      but not which specific bytes have been copied.
    </t>

    <t>
      If the optional osr_complete field is present, the copy has
      completed. In this case the status value indicates the result
      of the asynchronous copy operation. In all cases, the server
      will also deliver the final results of the asynchronous copy
      in a CB_OFFLOAD operation.
    </t>

    <t>
      The failure of this operation does not indicate the result of
      the asynchronous copy in any way.
    </t>

    <t>
      If the server supports asynchronous copies, the server is
      REQUIRED to support the OFFLOAD_STATUS operation.
