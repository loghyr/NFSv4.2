  <section toc='exclude' title="DESCRIPTION">
    <t>
      OFFLOAD_STATUS can be used by the client to query the progress of an
      asynchronous operation, which is identified both by CURRENT_FH and
      the osa_stateid.  If this operation is successful, the number of
      bytes processed are returned to the client in the osr_count
      field.
    </t>

    <t>
      If the optional osr_complete field is present, the asynchronous
      operation has completed. In this case the status value indicates
      the result of the asynchronous operation. In all cases, the server
      will also deliver the final results of the asynchronous operation
      in a CB_OFFLOAD operation.
    </t>

    <t>
      The failure of this operation does not indicate the result of
      the asynchronous operation in any way.
