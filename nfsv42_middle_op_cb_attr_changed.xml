    <t>
      The CB_ATTR_CHANGED callback operation is used by the
      server to indicate to the client that the file's attributes
      have been modified on the server. The server does not
      convey how the attributes have changed, just that they
      have been modified.  The server can inform the client
      about both critical and informational attribute changes
      in the bitmask arguments. The client SHOULD query the
      server about all attributes set in acca_critical. For
      all changes reflected in acca_info, the client can decide
      whether or not it wants to poll the server.
    </t>

    <t>
      The CB_ATTR_CHANGED callback operation with the FATTR4_SEC_LABEL
      set in acca_critical is the method used by the
      server to indicate that the MAC label for the file
      referenced by acca_fh has changed. In many ways, the
      server does not care about the result returned by the
      client.
