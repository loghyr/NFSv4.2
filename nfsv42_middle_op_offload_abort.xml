    <t>
      OFFLOAD_ABORT is used for both intra- and inter-server
      asynchronous copies. The OFFLOAD_ABORT operation allows the client
      to cancel a server-side copy operation that it initiated. This operation
      is sent in a COMPOUND request from the client to the destination
      server. This operation may be used to cancel a copy when
      the application that requested the copy exits before the operation
      is completed or for some other reason.
    </t>

    <t>
      The request contains the filehandle and copy stateid cookies
      that act as the context for the previously initiated copy
      operation.
    </t>

    <t>
      The result's oar_status field indicates whether the cancel
      was successful or not. A value of NFS4_OK indicates that the
      copy operation was canceled and no callback will be issued
      by the server. A copy operation that is successfully canceled
      may result in none, some, or all of the data and/or metadata copied.
    </t>

    <t>
      If the server supports asynchronous copies, the server is
      REQUIRED to support the OFFLOAD_ABORT operation.
