1) space_reserved flag - what does it mean now that reservations
   are byte ranges?

   See the recent chatter on the WG.

2) Do we want to maintain punch hole versus write zeros OR do we
   want to leave that to the server?

   We added this, but is it realistic?

   Also, is it a hint or mandatory?

   Either way, I want us to revisit it.

3) Need to document that we honor all NFSv4.1 Layout Types, stateids
   have not changed, etc.

   See the recent WG ML chatter over all of this.

4) Labeled NFS - FATTR4_CHANGE_SEC_LABEL - how big does it need to
   be?  Is seLinux going to support it?

   The Labeled NFS prototype in use does not currently support
   change_sec_label.

   In the past, we argued about how big it needed to be - we need
   to close down on this.

5) Consecutive byte copy flag and status updates for SSC

   Source modifies the cnr_copy_source to inform both the client
   and the destination as to whether each copy engine is going to
   copy bytes in consecutive order or not.

   Destination will need to modify the return from COPY to tell the
   client whether the copy engine it selected is doing consecutive
   order or not.

   Actually, it could return the item in the ca_copy_source that
   it selected.  This would allow the client to be aware of the
   selected copy engine as well.

6) Client wants to only do synchronous SSC or ALLOCATE or WRITE_HOLE

   The client wants to inform the destination in a SSC that it only
   wants to do the COPY iff the operation is going to synchronous.

   The client wants to inform the server that it only wants to
   do the ALLOCATE iff the operation is going to synchronous.

   The client wants to inform the server that it only wants to
   do the WRITE_HOLE iff the operation is going to synchronous.

   Some issues here are that for the SSC, the destination might
   have done some I/O before it decides that the COPY is going to
   be asynchronous???
