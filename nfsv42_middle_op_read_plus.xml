<section anchor='op:read_plus' title='Operation 65: READ_PLUS'>
  <t>
    The section introduces a new read operation, named READ_PLUS, which
    allows NFS clients to avoid reading holes in a sparse file and to
    efficiently transfer ADBs. READ_PLUS is guaranteed to perform no
    worse than READ, and can dramatically improve performance with
    sparse files.
  </t>

  <t>
    READ_PLUS supports all the features of the existing NFSv4.1 READ
    operation <xref target="ref:RFC5661" /> and adds a simple yet
    significant extension to the format of its response.  The
    change allows the client to avoid returning data for portions of
    the file which are either initialized nd contain no backing store
    or if the result would appear to be so. I.e., if the result was
    a data block composed entirely of zeros, then it is easier to return
    a hole. Returning data blocks of unitialized data wastes computational
    and network resources, thus reducing performance.  READ_PLUS uses a new
    result structure that tells the client that the result is all zeroes
    AND the byte-range of the hole in which the request was made.
  </t>

  <t>
    If the client sends a READ operation, it is explicitly
    stating that it is neither supporting sparse files or ADBs. So
    if a READ occurs on a sparse ADB or file, then the server must
    expand such data to be raw bytes. If a READ occurs in
    the middle of a hole or ADB, the server can only send back
    bytes starting from that offset.
  </t>

  <t>
    Such an operation is inefficient for transfer of sparse
    sections of the file. As such, READ is marked as OBSOLETE in
    NFSv4.2. Instead, a client should issue READ_PLUS. Note that
    as the client has no a priori knowledge of whether an ADB
    is present or not, it should always use READ_PLUS.
  </t>

  <section toc='exclude' title="DESCRIPTION">
    <t>
      Over the given range, READ_PLUS will return all data
      and ADBs found as an array of read_plus_content. It is
      possible to have consecutive ADBs in the array as
      either different definitions of ADBs are present or
      as the guard pattern changes.
    </t>

    <t>
      Edge cases exist for ABDs which either begin before the
      rpa_offset requested by the READ_PLUS or end after the
      rpa_count requested - both of which may occur as not all
      applications which access the file are aware of the
      main application imposing a format on the file contents, i.e.,
      tar, dd, cp, etc. READ_PLUS MUST retrieve whole ADBs, but
      it need not retrieve an entire sequences of ADBs.
    </t>

    <t>
      The server MUST return a whole ADB because if it does
      not, it must expand that partial ADB before it sends
      it to the client. E.g., if an ADB had a block size of
      64k and the READ_PLUS was for 128k starting at an
      offset of 32k inside the ADB, then the first 32k
      would be converted to data.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section toc='exclude' title="DESCRIPTION">
    <t>
      The READ_PLUS operation is based upon the NFSv4.1 READ operation
      <xref target="ref:RFC5661" />, and similarly reads data from the
      regular file identified by the current filehandle.
    </t>

    <t>
      The client provides an offset of where the READ_PLUS is to start and a
      count of how many bytes are to be read.  An offset of zero means to
      read data starting at the beginning of the file.  If offset is
      greater than or equal to the size of the file, the status NFS4_OK is
      returned with nfs_readplusrestype4 set to READ_OK, data length set to
      zero, and eof set to TRUE.  The READ_PLUS is subject to access
      permissions checking.
    </t>

    <t>
      If the client specifies a count value of zero, the READ_PLUS succeeds
      and returns zero bytes of data, again subject to access permissions
      checking.  In all situations, the server may choose to return fewer
      bytes than specified by the client.  The client needs to check for
      this condition and handle the condition appropriately.
    </t>

    <t>
      If the client specifies an offset and count value that is entirely
      contained within a hole of the file, the status NFS4_OK is returned
      with nfs_readplusresok4 set to READ_HOLE, and if information is
      available regarding the hole, a nfs_readplusreshole structure
      containing the offset and range of the entire hole.  The
      nfs_readplusreshole structure is considered valid until the file is
      changed (detected via the change attribute).  The server MUST provide
      the same semantics for nfs_readplusreshole as if the client read the
      region and received zeroes; the implied holes contents lifetime MUST
      be exactly the same as any other read data.
    </t>

    <t>
      If the client specifies an offset and count value that begins in a
      non-hole of the file but extends into hole the server should return a
      short read with status NFS4_OK, nfs_readplusresok4 set to READ_OK,
      and data length set to the number of bytes returned.  The client will
      then issue another READ_PLUS for the remaining bytes, which the server
      will respond with information about the hole in the file.
    </t>

    <t>
      If the server knows that the requested byte range is into a hole of
      the file, but has no further information regarding the hole, it
      returns a nfs_readplusreshole structure with holeres4 set to
      HOLE_NOINFO.
    </t>

    <t>
      If hole information is available and can be returned to
      the client, the server returns a nfs_readplusreshole structure with
      the value of holeres4 to HOLE_INFO.  The values of hole_offset and
      hole_length define the byte-range for the current hole in the file.
      These values represent the information known to the server and may
      describe a byte-range smaller than the true size of the hole.
    </t>

    <t>
      Except when special stateids are used, the stateid value for a
      READ_PLUS request represents a value returned from a previous byte-
      range lock or share reservation request or the stateid associated
      with a delegation.  The stateid identifies the associated owners if
      any and is used by the server to verify that the associated locks are
      still valid (e.g., have not been revoked).
    </t>

    <t>
      If the read ended at the end-of-file (formally, in a correctly formed
      READ_PLUS operation, if offset + count is equal to the size of the
      file), or the READ_PLUS operation extends beyond the size of the file
      (if offset + count is greater than the size of the file), eof is
      returned as TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.  A successful READ_PLUS of
      an empty file will always return eof as TRUE.
    </t>

    <t>
      If the current filehandle is not an ordinary file, an error will be
      returned to the client.  In the case that the current filehandle
      represents an object of type NF4DIR, NFS4ERR_ISDIR is returned.  If
      the current filehandle designates a symbolic link, NFS4ERR_SYMLINK is
      returned.  In all other cases, NFS4ERR_WRONG_TYPE is returned.
    </t>

    <t>
      For a READ_PLUS with a stateid value of all bits equal to zero, the
      server MAY allow the READ_PLUS to be serviced subject to mandatory
      byte-range locks or the current share deny modes for the file.  For a
      READ_PLUS with a stateid value of all bits equal to one, the server
      MAY allow READ_PLUS operations to bypass locking checks at the server.
    </t>

    <t>
      On success, the current filehandle retains its value.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section toc='exclude' title="IMPLEMENTATION">
    <t>
      If the server returns a "short read" (i.e., fewer data than requested
      and eof is set to FALSE), the client should send another READ_PLUS to
      get the remaining data.  A server may return less data than requested
      under several circumstances.  The file may have been truncated by
      another client or perhaps on the server itself, changing the file
      size from what the requesting client believes to be the case.  This
      would reduce the actual amount of data available to the client.  It
      is possible that the server reduce the transfer size and so return a
      short read result.  Server resource exhaustion may also occur in a
      short read.
    </t>

    <t>
      If mandatory byte-range locking is in effect for the file, and if the
      byte-range corresponding to the data to be read from the file is
      WRITE_LT locked by an owner not associated with the stateid, the
      server will return the NFS4ERR_LOCKED error.  The client should try
      to get the appropriate READ_LT via the LOCK operation before re-
      attempting the READ_PLUS.  When the READ_PLUS completes, the client
      should release the byte-range lock via LOCKU. In addition, the
      server MUST return a nfs_readplusreshole structure with values of
      hole_offset and hole_length that are within the owner’s locked
      byte range.
    </t>

    <t>
      If another client has an OPEN_DELEGATE_WRITE delegation for the file
      being read, the delegation must be recalled, and the operation cannot
      proceed until that delegation is returned or revoked.  Except where
      this happens very quickly, one or more NFS4ERR_DELAY errors will be
      returned to requests made while the delegation remains outstanding.
      Normally, delegations will not be recalled as a result of a READ_PLUS
      operation since the recall will occur as a result of an earlier OPEN.
      However, since it is possible for a READ_PLUS to be done with a
      special stateid, the server needs to check for this case even though
      the client should have done an OPEN previously.
    </t>

    <section toc='exclude' title="Additional pNFS Implementation Information">

      <t>
        With pNFS, the semantics of using READ_PLUS remains the same.  Any
        data server MAY return a READ_HOLE result for a READ_PLUS request that
        it receives.
      </t>

      <t>
        When a data server chooses to return a READ_HOLE result, it has the
        option of returning hole information for the data stored on that
        data server (as defined by the data layout), but it MUST not return
        a nfs_readplusreshole structure with a byte range that includes
        data managed by another data server.

        <list style="numbers">
          <t>
            Data servers that cannot determine hole information
            SHOULD return HOLE_NOINFO.
          </t>

          <t>
            Data servers that can obtain hole information for the
            parts of the file stored on that data server, the data
            server SHOULD return HOLE_INFO and the byte range of
            the hole stored on that data server.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        A data server should do its best to return as much information about
        a hole as is feasible without having to contact the metadata server.
        If communication with the metadata server is required, then every
        attempt should be taken to minimize the number of requests.
      </t>
        
      <t>
        If mandatory locking is enforced, then the data server must also
        ensure that to return only information for a Hole that is within
        the owner’s locked byte range.

      To see how the return value READ_HOLE will work, the following table
      describes a sparse file.  For each byte range, the file contains
      either non-zero data or a hole. In addition, the server in this
      example uses a hole threshold of 32K.
