<section anchor='op:read_plus' title='Operation 65: READ_PLUS'>
  <t>
    READ_PLUS is a new read operation which
    allows NFS clients to avoid reading holes in a sparse file and to
    efficiently transfer ADBs.
    READ_PLUS supports all the features of the existing NFSv4.1 READ
    operation <xref target="ref:RFC5661" /> but also extends the response
    to avoid returning data for portions of
    the file which are either initialized and contain no backing store
    or if the result would appear to be so. I.e., if the result was
    a data block composed entirely of zeros, then it is easier to return
    a hole. Returning data blocks of unitialized data wastes computational
    and network resources, thus reducing performance.  READ_PLUS uses a new
    result structure that tells the client that the result is all zeroes
    AND the byte-range of the hole in which the request was made.
  </t>

  <t>
    If the client sends a READ operation, it is explicitly
    stating that it is neither supporting sparse files nor ADBs. So
    if a READ occurs on a sparse ADB or file, then the server must
    expand such data to be raw bytes. If a READ occurs in
    the middle of a hole or ADB, the server can only send back
    bytes starting from that offset.
  </t>

  <t>
    Such an operation is inefficient for transfer of sparse
    sections of the file. As such, READ is marked as OBSOLETE in
    NFSv4.2. Instead, a client should issue READ_PLUS. Note that
    as the client has no a priori knowledge of whether either an ADB
    or a hole is present or not, it should always use READ_PLUS.
  </t>

  <section toc='exclude' anchor='op:read_plus:desc'  title="DESCRIPTION">
    <t>
      The READ_PLUS operation is based upon the NFSv4.1 READ operation
      <xref target="ref:RFC5661" /> and similarly reads data from the
      regular file identified by the current filehandle.
    </t>

    <t>
      The client provides a rpa_offset of where the READ_PLUS is to start and a
      rpa_count of how many bytes are to be read.  A rpa_offset of zero means to
      read data starting at the beginning of the file.  If rpa_offset is
      greater than or equal to the size of the file, the status NFS4_OK is
      returned with di_length (the data length) set to zero and eof
      set to TRUE.  READ_PLUS is subject to access permissions checking.
    </t>

    <t>
      The READ_PLUS result is comprised of an array of rpr_contents, each of
      which describe a data_content4 type of data. For NFSv4.2, the allowed
      values are data, ADB, and hole. A server is required to support the
      data type, but neither ADB nor hole. Both an ADB and a hole must be
      returned in its entirety - clients must be prepared to get more
      information than they requested.
    </t>

    <t>
      READ_PLUS has to support all of the errors which are returned by READ
      plus NFS4ERR_UNION_NOTSUPP. If the client asks for a hole and the server
      does not support that arm of the discriminated union, but does support
      one or more additional arms, it can signal to the client that it supports
      the operation, but not the arm with NFS4ERR_UNION_NOTSUPP.
    </t>

    <t>
      If the data to be returned is comprised entirely of zeros, then
      the server may elect to return that data as a hole. The server
      differentiates this to the client by setting di_allocated to TRUE
      in this case. Note that in such a scenario, the server is not
      required to determine the full extent of the "hole" - it does not
      need to determine where the zeros start and end.
    </t>

    <t>
      The server may elect to return adjacent elements of the same type. For
      example, the guard pattern or block size of an ADB might change, which
      would require adjacent elements of type ADB. Likewise if the server
      has a range of data comprised entirely of zeros and then a hole, it
      might want to return two adjacent holes to the client.
    </t>

    <t>
      If the client specifies a rpa_count value of zero, the READ_PLUS succeeds
      and returns zero bytes of data, again subject to access permissions
      checking.  In all situations, the server may choose to return fewer
      bytes than specified by the client.  The client needs to check for
      this condition and handle the condition appropriately.
    </t>

    <t>
      If the client specifies an rpa_offset and rpa_count value that is entirely
      contained within a hole of the file, then the di_offset and di_length
      returned must be for the entire hole.  This result is considered valid
      until the file is changed (detected via the change attribute).  The
      server MUST provide the same semantics for the hole  as if the client
      read the region and received zeroes; the implied holes contents
      lifetime MUST be exactly the same as any other read data.
    </t>

    <t>
      If the client specifies an rpa_offset and rpa_count value that
      begins in a non-hole of the file but extends into hole the server
      should return an array comprised of both data and a hole. The
      client MUST be prepared for the server to reurn a short read
      describing just the data.  The client will
      then issue another READ_PLUS for the remaining bytes, which the server
      will respond with information about the hole in the file.
    </t>

    <t>
      Except when special stateids are used, the stateid value for a
      READ_PLUS request represents a value returned from a previous
      byte-range lock or share reservation request or the stateid associated
      with a delegation.  The stateid identifies the associated owners if
      any and is used by the server to verify that the associated locks are
      still valid (e.g., have not been revoked).
    </t>

    <t>
      If the read ended at the end-of-file (formally, in a correctly formed
      READ_PLUS operation, if rpa_offset + rpa_count is equal to the size of the
      file), or the READ_PLUS operation extends beyond the size of the file
      (if rpa_offset + rpa_count is greater than the size of the file), eof is
      returned as TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.  A successful READ_PLUS of
      an empty file will always return eof as TRUE.
    </t>

    <t>
      If the current filehandle is not an ordinary file, an error will be
      returned to the client.  In the case that the current filehandle
      represents an object of type NF4DIR, NFS4ERR_ISDIR is returned.  If
      the current filehandle designates a symbolic link, NFS4ERR_SYMLINK is
      returned.  In all other cases, NFS4ERR_WRONG_TYPE is returned.
    </t>

    <t>
      For a READ_PLUS with a stateid value of all bits equal to zero, the
      server MAY allow the READ_PLUS to be serviced subject to mandatory
      byte-range locks or the current share deny modes for the file.  For a
      READ_PLUS with a stateid value of all bits equal to one, the server
      MAY allow READ_PLUS operations to bypass locking checks at the server.
    </t>

    <t>
      On success, the current filehandle retains its value.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section toc='exclude' title="IMPLEMENTATION">
    <t>
      If the server returns a short read, then the client should send
      another READ_PLUS to
      get the remaining data.  A server may return less data than requested
      under several circumstances.  The file may have been truncated by
      another client or perhaps on the server itself, changing the file
      size from what the requesting client believes to be the case.  This
      would reduce the actual amount of data available to the client.  It
      is possible that the server reduced the transfer size and so return a
      short read result.  Server resource exhaustion may also occur in a
      short read.
    </t>

    <t>
      If mandatory byte-range locking is in effect for the file, and if the
      byte-range corresponding to the data to be read from the file is
      WRITE_LT locked by an owner not associated with the stateid, the
      server will return the NFS4ERR_LOCKED error.  The client should try
      to get the appropriate READ_LT via the LOCK operation before
      re-attempting the READ_PLUS.  When the READ_PLUS completes, the client
      should release the byte-range lock via LOCKU. In addition, the
      server MUST return an array of rpr_contents with values of
      that are within the owner’s locked byte range.
    </t>

    <t>
      If another client has an OPEN_DELEGATE_WRITE delegation for the file
      being read, the delegation must be recalled, and the operation cannot
      proceed until that delegation is returned or revoked.  Except where
      this happens very quickly, one or more NFS4ERR_DELAY errors will be
      returned to requests made while the delegation remains outstanding.
      Normally, delegations will not be recalled as a result of a READ_PLUS
      operation since the recall will occur as a result of an earlier OPEN.
      However, since it is possible for a READ_PLUS to be done with a
      special stateid, the server needs to check for this case even though
      the client should have done an OPEN previously.
    </t>

    <section toc='exclude' title="Additional pNFS Implementation Information">
      <t>
        With pNFS, the semantics of using READ_PLUS remains the same.  Any
        data server MAY return a hole or ADB result for a READ_PLUS request that
        it receives.
      </t>

      <t>
        When a data server chooses to return a hole result, it has the
        option of returning hole information for the data stored on that
        data server (as defined by the data layout), but it MUST not return
        results for a byte range that includes data managed by another data server.
        Data servers that can obtain hole information for the
        parts of the file stored on that data server, the data
        server SHOULD return HOLE_INFO and the byte range of
        the hole stored on that data server.
      </t>

      <t>
        A data server should do its best to return as much information about
        a hole as is feasible without having to contact the metadata server.
        If communication with the metadata server is required, then every
        attempt should be taken to minimize the number of requests.
      </t>
        
      <t>
        If mandatory locking is enforced, then the data server must also
        ensure that to return only information for a Hole that is within
        the owner’s locked byte range.

      The following table describes a sparse file.  For each byte

      Under the given circumstances, if a client was to read from the file
      with a max read size of 64K, the following will be
      the results for the given READ_PLUS calls.  This assumes the client has already opened the file,
      acquired a valid stateid ('s' in the example), and just needs to issue READ_PLUS requests.
    </t>

    <t>
      <list style="numbers">

          READ_PLUS(s, 0, 64K) --> NFS_OK, eof = false, &lt;data[0,32K], hole[32K,224K]&gt;.
          Since the first hole is less than the server's Hole Threshhold, the
          first 32K of the file is returned as data and the remaining 32K is
          returned as a hole which actually extends to 256K.

        <t>
          READ_PLUS(s, 32K, 64K) --> NFS_OK, eof = false, &lt;hole[32K,224K]&gt;
          The requested range was all zeros, and the current hole begins at offset 32K and is 224K
          in length. Note that the client should not have followed up the previous
          READ_PLUS request with this one as the hole information from the previous
          call extended past what the client was requesting.
