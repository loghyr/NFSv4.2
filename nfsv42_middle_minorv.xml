    NFSv4.2 is a minor version of NFSv4 and is built upon NFSv4.1
    as documented in <xref target="RFC5661" /> and
    <xref target="RFC5662" />.
  </t>

  <t>
    NFSv4.2 does not modify the rules applicable to the NFSv4
    versioning process and follows the rules set out in
    <xref target="RFC5661" /> or in standard-track documents updating
    that document (e.g., in an RFC based on
    <xref target="NFSv4-Versioning" />).
  </t>

  <t>
    NFSv4.2 only defines extensions to NFSv4.1, each of which may
    be supported (or not) independently.  It does not

        introduce infrastructural features

      <t>
        make existing features MANDATORY to NOT implement

      <t>
	change the status of existing features (i.e., by changing
	their status among OPTIONAL, RECOMMENDED, REQUIRED).
      </t>
    </list>
  </t>

  <t>
    NFSv4.2 is intended to use the least disruptive approach to the
    adding of OPTIONAL features that is available in the NFSv4
    versioning framework.  If necessary to maintain that status,
    attributes added in this document can be considered to be
    OPTIONAL (rather than RECOMMENDED).
  </t>

  <t>
    As described in <xref target='ss:pnfs:stateids' />, NFSv4.2
    pNFS metadata servers, when used with NFSv4.1 data servers,
    will be handing out layout stateid's to be used in the
    context of NFSv4.1 data IO operations.
