      <t>
        The space_reserve attribute is a read/write attribute of type
        boolean.  It is a per file attribute.  When the space_reserved
        attribute is set via SETATTR, the server must ensure that there is
        disk space to accommodate every byte in the file before it can return
        success.  If the server cannot guarantee this, it must return
        NFS4ERR_NOSPC.
      </t>

      <t>
        If the client tries to grow a file which has the space_reserved
        attribute set, the server must guarantee that there is disk space to
        accommodate every byte in the file with the new size before it can
        return success.  If the server cannot guarantee this, it must return
        NFS4ERR_NOSPC.
      </t>

      <t>
        It is not required that the server allocate the space to the file
        before returning success.  The allocation can be deferred, however,
        it must be guaranteed that it will not fail for lack of space.
      </t>

      <t>
        The value of space_reserved can be obtained at any time through
        GETATTR.
      </t>

      <t>
        In order to avoid ambiguity, the space_reserve bit cannot be set
        along with the size bit in SETATTR.  Increasing the size of a file
        with space_reserve set will fail if space reservation cannot be
        guaranteed for the new size.  If the file size is decreased, space
        reservation is only guaranteed for the new size and the extra blocks
        backing the file can be released.

      <t>
        space_freed gives the number of bytes freed if the file is deleted.
        This attribute is read only and is of type length4.  It is a per file
        attribute.
