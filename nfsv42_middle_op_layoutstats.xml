  <section toc='exclude' title="DESCRIPTION">
    <t>
      The client can use LAYOUTSTATS to inform the metadata server
      about its interaction with the layout represented by the
      current filehandle, client ID (derived from the session ID
      in the preceding SEQUENCE operation), byte-range (lea_offset
      + lea_length), and lea_stateid. lsa_read and lsa_write allow
      for non-Layout Type specific statistices to be reported.  The
      remaining information the client is presenting is specific
      to the Layout Type and presented in the lea_layoutupdate
      field. Each Layout Type MUST define the contents of
      lea_layoutupdate in their respective specifications.
    </t>

    <t>
      LAYOUTSTATS can be combined with IO_ADVISE (see
      <xref target='op:io_advise' />) to augment the decision making
      process of how the metadata server handles a file.  I.e.,
      IO_ADVISE lets the server know that a byte range has a certain
      characteristic, but not necessarily the intensity of that
      characteristic.
