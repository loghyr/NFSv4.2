    <t>
      The NFS version 4 minor version 2 (NFSv4.2) protocol is the third
      minor version of the NFS version 4 (NFSv4) protocol.  The first minor
      version, NFSv4.0, is described in <xref target="RFC3530bis" /> and the second minor version,
      NFSv4.1, is described in <xref target="RFC5661" />.  It follows the
      guidelines for minor versioning that are listed in Section 11 of RFC
      3530bis.
    </t>

    <t>
      As a minor version, NFSv4.2 is consistent with the overall goals for
      NFSv4, but extends the protocol so as to better meet those goals,
      based on experiences with NFSv4.1.  In addition, NFSv4.2 has adopted
      some additional goals, which motivate some of the major extensions in
      NFSv4.2.
