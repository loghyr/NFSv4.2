  <section title="The NFS Version 4 Minor Version 2 Protocol">
    <t>
      The NFS version 4 minor version 2 (NFSv4.2) protocol is the third
      minor version of the NFS version 4 (NFSv4) protocol.  The first minor
      version, NFSv4.0, is described in <xref target="ref:RFC3530bis" /> and the second minor version,
      NFSv4.1, is described in <xref target="ref:RFC5661" />.  It follows the
      guidelines for minor versioning that are listed in Section 11 of
      <xref target="ref:RFC3530bis" />.
    </t>

    <t>
      As a minor version, NFSv4.2 is consistent with the overall goals for
      NFSv4, but extends the protocol so as to better meet those goals,
      based on experiences with NFSv4.1.  In addition, NFSv4.2 has adopted
      some additional goals, which motivate some of the major extensions in
      NFSv4.2.

          clarify the NFSv4.0 or NFSv4.1 protocols. I.e., any clarifications made

    <section title="Application I/O Advise">
      <t>
        We propose a new IO_ADVISE operation for NFSv4.2 that
        clients can use to communicate expected I/O behavior to the server.
        By communicating future I/O behavior such as whether a file will be
        accessed sequentially or randomly, and whether a file will or will
        not be accessed in the near future, servers can optimize future I/O
        requests for a file by, for example, prefetching or evicting data.
        This operation can be used to support the posix_fadvise function as
        well as other applications such as databases and video editors.
