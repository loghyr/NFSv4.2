<section anchor="xdr_desc" title="XDR Description of NFSv4.2 " >
  <t>
    This document contains the XDR (<xref target="RFC4506" />)
    description of NFSv4.2 protocol (<xref target="NFSv42" />). In
    order to facilitate implementations that support all of NFSv4.0,
    NFSv4.1, and NFSv4.2, the description includes operations, and
    other features of NFSv4.0 and NFSv4.1 that do not apply to
    NFSv4.2.
  </t>

  <t>
    The XDR description is provided in this document in a way that
    makes it simple for the reader to extract into ready to compile
    form. The reader can feed this document in the following shell
    script to produce the machine readable XDR description of
    NFSv4.2:
  </t>

  <figure>
    <artwork>
#!/bin/sh
grep "^  *///" | sed 's?^  */// ??' | sed 's?^  *///$??'
    </artwork>
  </figure>

  <t>
    I.e., if the above script is stored in a file called "extract.sh",
    and this document is in a file called "spec.txt", then the
    reader can do:
  </t>

  <figure>
    <artwork>
 sh extract.sh &lt; spec.txt &gt; nfs4_prot.x
    </artwork>
  </figure>

  <t>
     The effect of the script is to remove leading white space
     from each line, plus a sentinel sequence of "///".
  </t>

  <t>
     The XDR description, with the sentinel sequence follows:
