  <section toc='exclude' title='MOTIVATION'>
    <t>
      The GETDEVICELIST operation was introduced in <xref target='RFC5661' />
      specifically to request a list of devices at filesystem mount time
      from block layout type servers.  However use of the GETDEVICELIST
      operation introduces a race condition versus notification about
      changes to pNFS device IDs as provided by CB_NOTIFY_DEVICEID.
      Implementation experience with block layout servers has shown there
      is no need for GETDEVICELIST.  Clients have to be able to request
      new devices using GETDEVICEINFO at any time in response either to
      a new deviceid in LAYOUTGET results or to the CB_NOTIFY_DEVICEID
      callback operation.

  <section toc='exclude' title='DESCRIPTION'>
    <t>
       Clients and servers MUST NOT implement the GETDEVICELIST operation.
