    <t>
       The GETDEVICELIST operation was introduced in <xref target='RFC5661' />
       specificly to request a list of devices at filesystem mount time from
       block layout type servers.  However use of the GETDEVICELIST operation
       introduces a race condition vs notification about changes to pNFS
       device IDs as provided by CB_NOTIFY_DEVICEID.
       Furthermore there is no actual need for GETDEVICELIST to implement
       a fully working block layout server, and clients have to be able
       to request new devices ues GETDEVICEINFO at any time in response
       to a new deviceid in LAYOUTGET results, or in response to the
       CB_NOTIFY_DEVICEID callback operation anyway.

  <section toc='exclude' title='DESCRIPTION'>
    <t>
      Clients and servers MUST NOT implement the GETDEVICELIST operation.
