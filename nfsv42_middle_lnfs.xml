    WARNING: Need to pull out the requirements.
  </t>
  
  <section anchor="ss:lnfs:intro" title="Introduction">
    <t>
      Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems have been mainstreamed in
      modern operating systems such as Linux (R), FreeBSD (R), Solaris
      (TM), and Windows Vista (R).  MAC systems bind security attributes to
      subjects (processes) and objects within a system.  These attributes
      are used with other information in the system to make access control
      decisions.
    </t>
  
    <t>
      Access control models such as Unix permissions or Access Control
      Lists are commonly referred to as Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
      models.  These systems base their access decisions on user identity
      and resource ownership.  In contrast MAC models base their access
      control decisions on the label on the subject (usually a process) and
      the object it wishes to access.  These labels may contain user
      identity information but usually contain additional information.  In
      DAC systems users are free to specify the access rules for resources
      that they own.  MAC models base their security decisions on a system
      wide policy established by an administrator or organization which the
      users do not have the ability to override.  DAC systems offer no real
      protection against malicious or flawed software due to each program
      running with the full permissions of the user executing it.
      Inversely MAC models can confine malicious or flawed software and
      usually act at a finer granularity than their DAC counterparts.
    </t>
  
    <t>
      People desire to use NFSv4 with these systems.  A mechanism is
      required to provide security attribute information to NFSv4 clients
      and servers.  This mechanism has the following requirements:
    </t>
  
    <t>
      <list style='format (%d)'>
        <t>
          Clients must be able to convey to the server the security
          attribute of the subject making the access request.  The server
          may provide a mechanism to enforce MAC policy based on the
          requesting subject's security attribute.
        </t>
  
        <t>
          Server must be able to store and retrieve the security attribute
          of exported files as requested by the client.
        </t>
  
        <t>
          Server must provide a mechanism for notifying clients of attribute
          changes of files on the server.
        </t>
  
        <t>
          Clients and Servers must be able to negotiate Label Formats and
          Domains of Interpretation (DOI) and provide a mechanism to
          translate between them as needed.
        </t>
      </list>
    </t>
  
    <t>
      These four requirements are key to the system with only requirements
      (2) and (3) requiring changes to NFSv4.  The ability to convey
      the security attribute of the subject as described in requirement (1)
      falls upon the RPC layer to implement
      (see <xref target='ref:rpcsecgssv3' />).  Requirement (4) allows
      communication between different MAC implementations.  The management
      of label formats, DOIs, and the translation between them does not
      require any support from NFSv4 on a protocol level and is out of the
      scope of this document.
    </t>
  
    <t>
      The first change necessary is to devise a method for transporting
      and storing security label data on NFSv4 file objects.  Security
      labels have several semantics that are met by NFSv4 recommended
      attributes such as the ability to set the label value upon object
      creation.  Access control on these attributes are done through a
      combination of two mechanisms.  As with other recommended attributes
      on file objects the usual DAC checks (ACLs and permission bits) will
      be performed to ensure that proper file ownership is enforced.  In
      addition a MAC system MAY be employed on the client, server, or both to
      enforce additional policy on what subjects may modify security label
      information.
    </t>
  
    <t>
      The second change is to provide a method for the server to
      notify the client that the attribute changed on an open
      file on the server. If the file is closed, then during the
      open attempt, the client will gather the new attribute value.
      The server MUST not communicate the new value of the attribute,
      the client MUST query it. This requirement stems from the
      need for the client to provide sufficient access rights to
      the attribute.
    </t>
  
    <t>
      The final change necessary is a modification to the RPC layer used
      in NFSv4 in the form of a new version of the
      RPCSEC_GSS <xref target='ref:RFC2203' /> framework.
      In order for an NFSv4 server to apply MAC checks it must obtain
      additional information from the client.  Several methods were explored for
      performing this and it was decided that the best approach was to
      incorporate the ability to make security attribute assertions through
      the RPC mechanism.  RPCSECGSSv3 <xref target='ref:rpcsecgssv3' />
      outlines a method to assert additional security information
      such as security labels on gss context creation and have that data
      bound to all RPC requests that make use of that context.

      MAC models base access decisions on security attributes bound to
      subjects and objects.  This information can range from a user
      identity for an identity based MAC model, sensitivity levels for
      Multi-level security, or a type for Type Enforcement.  These models
      base their decisions on different criteria but the semantics of the
      security attribute remain the same.  The semantics required by the
      security attributes are listed below:
    </t>

        <t>
          Must not expose an object to either the client or server name

      </list>
    </t>
  
    <t>
      NFSv4 provides several options for implementing the security
      attribute.  The first option is to implement the security attribute
      as a named attribute.  Named attributes provide flexibility since
      they are treated as an opaque field but lack a way to atomically set
      the attribute on creation.  In addition, named attributes themselves
      are file system objects which need to be assigned a security
      attribute.  This raises the question of how to assign security
      attributes to the file and directories used to hold the security
      attribute for the file in question.  The inability to atomically
      assign the security attribute on file creation and the necessity to
      assign security attributes to its sub-components makes named
      attributes unacceptable as a method for storing security attributes.
    </t>
  
    <t>
      The second option is to implement the security attribute as a
      recommended attribute.  These attributes have a fixed format
      and semantics, which
      conflicts with the flexible nature of the security attribute.  To
      resolve this the security attribute consists of two components.  The
      first component is a LFS as defined in <xref target='ref:lfsreg' />
      to allow for interoperability between MAC
      mechanisms.  The second component is an opaque field which is the actual
      security attribute data.  To allow for various MAC models NFSv4
      should be used solely as a transport mechanism for the security
      attribute.  It is the responsibility of the endpoints to consume the
      security attribute and make access decisions based on their
      respective models.  In addition, creation of objects through OPEN and
      CREATE allows for the security attribute to be specified upon
      creation.  By providing an atomic create and set operation for the
      security attribute it is possible to enforce the second and fourth
      requirements.  The recommended attribute FATTR4_SEC_LABEL will
      be used to satisfy this requirement.
    </t>
  
    <section anchor='ss:macss:lnfs:interpret' title='Interpreting FATTR4_SEC_LABEL'>
      <t>
        The XDR <xref target='ref:RFC4506' /> necessary to implement Labeled
        NFSv4 is presented in <xref target='fig:xdr' />:
      </t>
  
      <figure anchor='fig:xdr'>
        <artwork>
      const FATTR4_SEC_LABEL   = 81;
  
      typedef uint32_t  policy4;
      struct labelformat_spec4 {
        policy4   lfs_lfs;
        policy4   lfs_pi;
      };
  
      struct sec_label_attr_info {
        labelformat_spec4   slai_lfs;
        opaque              slai_data&lt;&gt;;
      };
        </artwork>
      </figure>
  
      <t>
        The FATTR4_SEC_LABEL contains an array of two components with the first
        component being an LFS.  It serves to provide the receiving end
        with the information necessary to translate the security attribute
        into a form that is usable by the endpoint.  Label Formats assigned
        an LFS may optionally choose to include a Policy Identifier
        field to allow for complex policy deployments.  The LFS
        and Label Format Registry are described in detail in
        <xref target='ref:lfsreg' />.
        The translation used to interpret the security
        attribute is not specified as part of the protocol as it may depend
        on various factors.  The second component is an opaque section which
        contains the data of the attribute.  This component is dependent on
        the MAC model to interpret and enforce.
      </t>
      <t>
        In particular, it is the responsibility of the LFS specification
        to define a maximum size for the opaque section, slai_data&lt;&gt;.
        When creating or modifying a label for an object, the client
        needs to be guaranteed that the server will accept a label
        that is sized correctly. By both client and server being part
        of a specific MAC model, the client will be aware of the size.
      </t>

    <section anchor='ss:macss:lnfs:delegs' title='Delegations'>
      <t>
        In the event that a security attribute is changed on the server while
        a client holds a delegation on the file, the client should follow the
        existing protocol with respect to attribute changes.  It should flush
        all changes back to the server and relinquish the delegation.
      </t>
    </section>
  
    <section anchor='ss:macss:lnfs:perms' title='Permission Checking'>
      <t>
        It is not feasible to enumerate all possible MAC models and even
        levels of protection within a subset of these models.  This means
        that the NFSv4 client and servers cannot be expected to directly
        make access control decisions based on the security attribute.
        Instead NFSv4 should defer permission checking on this attribute to
        the host system.  These checks are performed in addition to existing
        DAC and ACL checks outlined in the NFSv4 protocol.
        <xref target='ss:lnfs:modes' />  gives a
        specific example of how the security attribute is handled under a
        particular MAC model.
      </t>
    </section>
  
    <section anchor='ss:macss:lnfs:objects' title='Object Creation'>
      <t>
        When creating files in NFSv4 the OPEN and CREATE operations are used.
        One of the parameters to these operations is an fattr4 structure
        containing the attributes the file is to be created with.  This
        allows NFSv4 to atomically set the security attribute of files upon
        creation.  When a client is MAC aware it must always provide the
        initial security attribute upon file creation.  In the event that the
        server is the only MAC aware entity in the system it should ignore
        the security attribute specified by the client and instead make the
        determination itself.  A more in depth explanation can be found in
        <xref target='ss:lnfs:modes' />.
      </t>
    </section>
  
    <section anchor='ss:macss:lnfs:existing' title='Existing Objects'>
      <t>
        Note that under the MAC model, all objects must have labels.
        Therefore, if an existing server is upgraded to include LNFS support,
        then it is the responsibility of the security system to
        define the behavior for existing objects. For example, if
        the security system is LFS 0, which means the server just
        stores and returns labels, then existing files should
        return labels which are set to an empty value.
      </t>
    </section>
  
    <section anchor='ss:macss:lnfs:changes' title='Label Changes'>
      <t>
        As per the requirements, when a file's security label is
        modified, the server must notify all clients which have
        the file opened of the change in label. It does so with
        CB_ATTR_CHANGED. There are preconditions to making an
        attribute change imposed by NFSv4 and the security system might
        want to impose others. In the process of meeting these
        preconditions, the server may chose to either serve
        the request in whole or return NFS4ERR_DELAY to the
        SETATTR operation.
      </t>
  
      <t>
        If there are open delegations on the file
        belonging to client other than the one making the label
        change, then the process described in
        <xref target='ss:macss:lnfs:delegs' /> must be followed.
      </t>
  
      <t>
        As the server is always presented with the subject
        label from the client, it does not necessarily need to
        communicate the fact that the label has changed to
        the client. In the cases where the change outright denies
        the client access, the client will be able to quickly
        determine that there is a new label in effect. It is
        in cases where the client may share the same object
        between multiple subjects or a security system which
        is not strictly hierarchical that the CB_ATTR_CHANGED callback is
        very useful. It allows the server to inform the clients
        that the cached security attribute is now stale.
      </t>
  
      <t>
        In the scenario presented in <xref target='ss:examples:simple' />,
        the clients are smart and the server has a very simple security
        system which just stores the labels. In this system, the
        MAC label check always allows access, regardless of the
        subject label. 
      </t>
  
      <t>
        The way in which MAC labels are enforced is by the smart
        client. So if client A changes a security label on a file,
        then the server MUST inform all clients that have the file
        opened that the label has changed via CB_ATTR_CHANGED. Then
        the clients MUST retrieve the new label and MUST enforce
        access via the new attribute values.

        The CB_ATTR_CHANGED callback operation is used by the

        have been modified on the server. The server does not
        convey how the attributes have changed, just that they
        have been modified.  The server can inform the client
        about both critical and informational attribute changes
        in the bitmask arguments. The client SHOULD query the
        server about all attributes set in acca_critical. For
        all changes reflected in acca_info, the client can decide

        The new FATTR4_SEC_LABEL attribute is metadata information

  <section anchor='ss:lnfs:discovery' title='Discovery of Server LNFS Support'>
    <t>
      The server can easily determine that a client supports LNFS
      when it queries for the FATTR4_SEC_LABEL label for an object.
      Note that it cannot assume that the presence of RPCSEC_GSSv3
      indicates LNFS support. The client might need to discover
      which LFS the server supports.
    </t>
  
    <t>
      A server which supports LNFS MUST allow a client with any subject
      label to retrieve the FATTR4_SEC_LABEL attribute for the root
      filehandle, ROOTFH. The following compound must always succeed
      as far as a MAC label check is concerned:

    <t>
      Note that the server might have imposed a security flavor on
      the root that precludes such access. I.e., if the server
      requires kerberized access and the client presents a compound
      with AUTH_SYS, then the server is allowed to return NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC
      in this case. But if the client presents a correct security
      flavor, then the server MUST return the FATTR4_SEC_LABEL attribute

    <t>
      A system using Labeled NFS may operate in three modes.  The first
      mode provides the most protection and is called "full mode".  In this
      mode both the client and server implement a MAC model allowing each
      end to make an access control decision.  The remaining two modes are
      variations on each other and are called "smart client" and "smart
      server" modes.  In these modes one end of the connection is not
      implementing a MAC model and because of this these operating modes
      offer less protection than full mode.

    <section anchor='ss:modes:full' title='Full Mode'>
      <t>
        Full mode environments consist of MAC aware NFSv4 servers and clients
        and may be composed of mixed MAC models and policies.  The system
        requires that both the client and server have an opportunity to
        perform an access control check based on all relevant information
        within the network.  The file object security attribute is provided
        using the mechanism described in <xref target='ss:lnfs:macsec' />.  The
        security attribute of the subject making the request is transported
        at the RPC layer using the mechanism described in RPCSECGSSv3
        <xref target='ref:rpcsecgssv3' />.
      </t>
  
      <section anchor='ss:modes:fm_ilt' title='Initial Labeling and Translation'>
        <t>
          The ability to create a file is an action that a MAC model may wish
          to mediate.  The client is given the responsibility to determine the
          initial security attribute to be placed on a file.  This allows the
          client to make a decision as to the acceptable security attributes to
          create a file with before sending the request to the server.  Once
          the server receives the creation request from the client it may
          choose to evaluate if the security attribute is acceptable.
        </t>
  
        <t>
          Security attributes on the client and server may vary based on MAC
          model and policy.  To handle this the security attribute field has an
          LFS component.  This component is a mechanism for the host to
          identify the format and meaning of the opaque portion of the security
          attribute.  A full mode environment may contain hosts operating in
          several different LFSs and DOIs.  In this case a mechanism for
          translating the opaque portion of the security attribute is needed.
          The actual translation function will vary based on MAC model and
          policy and is out of the scope of this document.  If a translation is
          unavailable for a given LFS and DOI then the request SHOULD be
          denied.  Another recourse is to allow the host to provide a fallback
          mapping for unknown security attributes.

        <t>
          In full mode access control decisions are made by both the clients
          and servers.  When a client makes a request it takes the security
          attribute from the requesting process and makes an access control
          decision based on that attribute and the security attribute of the
          object it is trying to access.  If the client denies that access an
          RPC call to the server is never made.  If however the access is
          allowed the client will make a call to the NFS server.
        </t>
  
        <t>
          When the server receives the request from the client it extracts the
          security attribute conveyed in the RPC request.  The server then uses
          this security attribute and the attribute of the object the client is
          trying to access to make an access control decision.  If the server's
          policy allows this access it will fulfill the client's request,
          otherwise it will return NFS4ERR_ACCESS.

          Implementations MAY validate security attributes supplied over the
          network to ensure that they are within a set of attributes permitted
          from a specific peer, and if not, reject them.  Note that a system
          may permit a different set of attributes to be accepted from each

        The system requires that all clients in the environment be
        responsible for access control checks.  Due to the amount of trust

          Just like in full mode the client is responsible for determining the
          initial label upon object creation.  The server in smart client mode
          does not implement a MAC model, however, it may provide the ability
          to restrict the creation and labeling of object with certain labels

          In a smart client environment a group of clients operate in a single

          translations.  Servers should provide a method to allow different
          groups of clients to access the server at the same time.  However it
          should not let two groups of clients operating in different DOIs to
          access the same files.

          In smart client mode access control decisions are made by the

          attribute of the object from the server and combines it with the
          security attribute of the process making the request to make an
          access control decision.  This check is in addition to the DAC checks
          provided by NFSv4 so this may fail based on the DAC criteria even if
          the MAC policy grants access.  As the policy check is located on the
          client an access control denial should take the form that is native

        Smart server environments consist of NFSv4 servers that are MAC aware
        and one or more MAC unaware clients.  The server is the only entity
        enforcing policy, and may selectively provide standard NFS services
        to clients based on their authentication credentials and/or
        associated network attributes (e.g., IP address, network interface).
        The level of trust and access extended to a client in this mode is
        configuration-specific.
      </t>
  
      <section anchor='ss:modes:ss_ilt' title='Initial Labeling and Translation'>
        <t>
          In smart server mode all labeling and access control decisions are
          performed by the NFSv4 server.  In this environment the NFSv4 clients
          are not MAC aware so they cannot provide input into the access
          control decision.  This requires the server to determine the initial
          labeling of objects.  Normally the subject to use in this calculation
          would originate from the client.  Instead the NFSv4 server may choose
          to assign the subject security attribute based on their
          authentication credentials and/or associated network attributes (e.g.,
          IP address, network interface).
        </t>
  
        <t>
          In smart server mode security attributes are contained solely within
          the NFSv4 server.  This means that all security attributes used in
          the system remain within a single LFS and DOI.  Since security
          attributes will not cross DOIs or change format there is no need to
          provide any translation functionality above that which is needed
          internally by the MAC model.

        <t>
          All access control decisions in smart server mode are made by the
          server.  The server will assign the subject a security attribute
          based on some criteria (e.g., IP address, network interface).  Using
          the newly calculated security attribute and the security attribute of
          the object being requested the MAC model makes the access control
          check and returns NFS4ERR_ACCESS on a denial and NFS4_OK on success.
          This check is done transparently to the client so if the MAC
          permission check fails the client may be unaware of the reason for
          the permission failure.  When operating in this mode administrators
          attempting to debug permission failures should be aware to check the
          MAC policy running on the server in addition to the DAC settings.

      MAC labeling is meant to allow NFSv4 to be deployed in site
      configurable security schemes. The LFS and opaque data scheme
      allows for flexibility to meet these different implementations.

        In this case, we assume a local networked environment where the

        systems in this network have the same MAC implementation and
        semantically identical MAC security labels for objects (i.e. labels
        mean the same thing on different systems, even if the policies on
        each system may differ to some extent).  Clients will be able to
        apply fine-grained MAC policy to objects accessed via NFS mounts, and
        thus improve the overall consistency of MAC policy application within
        this environment.
      </t>
  
      <t>
        An example of this case would be where user home directories are

        protect, for example, private user data from being read by malicious
        web scripts running in the user's browser.  With Labeled NFS,
        fine-grained MAC labeling of the user's files will allow the local MAC

        associated with these activities.  ESI Data Maps are increasing
        in use and require support in operating systems to strictly
        manage access controls in the case of a legal hold.  The
        sizeable quantity of information involved in a legal discovery
        request may preclude making a copy of the information to a
        separate system that manages the legal hold on the copies;
        this results in a need to enforce the legal hold on the
        original information.

      <t>
        Organizations are taking steps to map out the sources of
        information that are most likely to be placed under a legal
        hold, these efforts result in ESI Data Maps.  ESI Data Maps
        specify the Electronic Source of Information and the requirements
        for sensitivity and criticality.  In the case of a legal hold,
        the ESI data map and labels can be used to ensure the legal
        hold is properly enforced on the predetermined set of
        information.  An ESI data map narrows the scope of a legal
        hold to the predetermined ESI.  The information must then be
        protected at a level of security of which the weight and
        admissibility of that evidence may be proved in a court of
        law.  Current systems use application level controls and do
        not adequately meet the requirements.  Labels may be used in
        advance when an ESI data map exercise is conducted with
        controls being applied at the time of a hold or labels may
        be applied to data sets during an eDiscovery exercise to
        ensure the data protections are adequate during the legal
        hold period.

        Note that this use case requires multi-attribute labels, as
        both information sensitivity (e.g., to disclosure) and

        need to be captured.

        In this case, a mixed and loosely administered network is assumed,

        that network file servers be simply capable of storing and retrieving
        MAC security labels for clients which use such labels.  The Labeled

        MAC security labels across the network.  It should be noted that in
        such an environment, overall security cannot be as strongly enforced
        as in case (a), and that this scheme is aimed at allowing MAC-capable

    <section anchor='ss:examples:diskless' title='Diskless Linux'>
      <t>
        A number of popular operating system distributions depend on
        a mandatory access control (MAC) model to implement a
        kernel-enforced security policy. Typically, such models assign
        particular roles to individual processes, which limit or
        permit performing certain operations on a set of files,
        directories, sockets, or other objects.  While the enforcing
        of the policy is typically a matter for the diskless NFS
        client itself, the filesystem objects in such models will
        typically carry MAC labels that are used to define policy on
        access.  These policies may, for instance, describe privilege
        transitions that cannot be replicated using standard NFS ACL
        based models.
      </t>
  
      <t>
        For instance on a SYSV compatible system, if the 'init' process
        spawns a process that attempts to start the 'NetworkManager'
        executable, there may be a policy that sets up a role transition
        if the 'init' process and 'NetworkManager' file labels match
        a particular rule. Without this role transition, the process
        may find itself having insufficient privileges to perform its
        primary job of configuring network interfaces.
      </t>
  
      <t>
        In setups of this type, a lot of the policy targets (such as
        sockets or privileged system calls) are entirely local to the
        client. The use of RPCSEC_GSSv3 for enforcing compliance at
        the server level is therefore of limited value. The ability
        to permanently label files and have those labels read back
        by the client is, however, crucial to the ability to enforce
        that policy.

    <section anchor='ss:examples:mls' title='Multi-Level Security'>
      <t>
        In a MLS system objects are generally assigned
        a sensitivity level and a set of compartments.  The sensitivity
        levels within the system are given an order ranging from lowest to
        highest classification level.  Read access to an object is allowed
        when the sensitivity level of the subject "dominates" the object it
        wants to access.  This means that the sensitivity level of the
        subject is higher than that of the object it wishes to access and
        that its set of compartments is a super-set of the compartments on
        the object.
      </t>
  
      <t>
        The rest of the section will just use sensitivity levels.  In general
        the example is a client that wishes to list the contents of a
        directory.  The system defines the sensitivity levels as
        Unclassified (U), Secret (S), and Top Secret (TS).  The directory to be
        searched is labeled Top Secret which means access to read the
        directory will only be granted if the subject making the request is
        also labeled Top Secret.
      </t>
  
      <section anchor='ss:examples:fm' title='Full Mode'>
        <t>
          In the first part of this example a process on the client is running
          at the Secret level.  The process issues a readdir system call which
          enters the kernel.  Before translating the readdir system call into a
          request to the NFSv4 server the host operating system will consult
          the MAC module to see if the operation is allowed.  Since the process
          is operating at Secret and the directory to be accessed is labeled
          Top Secret the MAC module will deny the request and an error code is
          returned to user space.
        </t>
  
        <t>
          Consider a second case where instead of running at Secret the process
          is running at Top Secret.  In this case the sensitivity of the
          process is equal to or greater than that of the directory so the MAC
          module will allow the request.  Now the readdir is translated into
          the necessary NFSv4 call to the server.  For the RPC request the
          client is using the proper credential to assert to the server that
          the process is running at Top Secret.
        </t>
  
        <t>
          When the server receives the request it extracts the security label
          from the RPC session and retrieves the label on the directory.  The
          server then checks with its MAC module if a Top Secret process is
          allowed to read the contents of the Top Secret directory.  Since this
          is allowed by the policy then the server will return the appropriate
          information back to the client.
        </t>
  
        <t>
          In this example the policy on the client and server were both the
          same.  In the event that they were running different policies a
          translation of the labels might be needed.  In this case it could be
          possible for a check to pass on the client and fail on the server.
          The server may consider additional information when making its policy
          decisions.  For example the server could determine that a certain
          subnet is only cleared for data up to Secret classification.  If that
          constraint was in place for the example above the client would still
          succeed, but the server would fail since the client is asserting a
          label that it is not able to use (Top Secret on a Secret network).

          In smart client mode the example is identical to the first part of a
          full mode operation.  A process on the client labeled Secret wishes
          to access a Top Secret directory.  As in the full mode example this
          is denied since Secret does not dominate Top Secret.  If the process
          were operating at Top Secret it would pass the local access control
          check and the NFSv4 operation would proceed as in a normal NFSv4
          environment.

        <t>
          In a smart server mode the client behaves as if it were in a normal
          NFSv4 environment.  Since the process on the client does not provide
          a security attribute the server must define a mechanism for labeling
          all requests from a client.  Assume that the server is using the same
          criteria used in the full mode example.  The server sees the request
          as coming from a subnet that is a Secret network.  The server
          determines that all clients on that subnet will have their requests
          labeled with Secret.  Since the directory on the server is labeled
          Top Secret and Secret does not dominate Top Secret the server would
          fail the request with NFS4ERR_ACCESS.

      When either the client is in Smart Client Mode or server is in

      An example of this is that a smart server that modifies READDIR
      or LOOKUP results based on the client's subject label might want
