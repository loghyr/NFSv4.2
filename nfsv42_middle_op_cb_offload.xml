    <t>
      CB_OFFLOAD is used for both intra- and inter-server asynchronous
      copies. The CB_OFFLOAD callback informs the client of the result of
      an asynchronous server-side copy. This operation is sent by the
      destination server to the client in a CB_COMPOUND request. The
      copy is identified by the filehandle and stateid arguments. The result
      is indicated by the status field. If the copy failed, cca_bytes_copied
      contains the number of bytes copied before the failure occurred.
      The cca_bytes_copied value indicates the number of bytes copied
      but not which specific bytes have been copied.
    </t>

    <t>
      If the client supports the COPY operation, the client is
      REQUIRED to support the CB_OFFLOAD operation.
    </t>

    <t>
      There is a potential race between the reply to the original COPY on
      the forechannel and the CB_OFFLOAD callback on the backchannel.
      Sections 2.10.6.3 and 20.9.3 in <xref target="ref:RFC5661" />
      describes how to handle this type of issue.
