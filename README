To build the current RFC run make in the current directory, which will
generated the draft-ietf-nfsv4-minorversion2-<currentdraft>.txt file.

Note that the makefiles expect the xml2rfc tool to have .tcl extension which it
does not seem to have on any Unix-like system, so two makefiles will need

The editor for the NFSv4 minor version 2 internet draft uses this site as a method of distributing content and issue tracking. The latest version of the NFSv4.2 I-D is always found on the IETF site. The NFSv4 WG page will have pointers to all of this and includes a pointer to the email archive as well.
