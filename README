The editor for the NFSv4 minor version 2 internet draft uses this site as a method of distributing content and issue tracking. The latest version of the NFSv4.2 I-D is always found on the IETF site. The NFSv4 WG page will have pointers to all of this and includes a pointer to the email archive as well.
