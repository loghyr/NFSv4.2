The editor for the NFSv4 minor version 2 internet draft uses this
site as a method of distributing content and issue tracking.
The latest version of the NFSv4.2 I-D is always found on the
IETF site. The NFSv4 WG page will have pointers to all of
this and includes a pointer to the email archive as well.

To compile the XML files into text files:

1. Install xml2rfc
   Check with http://xml.resource.org/, but basically:

#
# Install xml2rfc
#
curl -O https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
pip install xml2rfc

   These instructions have been tested with version 2. The
   documents no longer build with the version 1.36.

2. Build

   > make

The will generate the draft-ietf-nfsv4-minorversion2-<currentdraft>.txt file.
