    <t>
      COPY_STATUS is used for both intra- and inter-server asynchronous
      copies. The COPY_STATUS operation allows the client to poll the
      server to determine the status of an asynchronous copy operation.
      This operation is sent by the client to the destination server.
    </t>

    <t>
      If this operation is successful, the number of bytes copied are
      returned to the client in the csr_bytes_copied field. The
      csr_bytes_copied value indicates the number of bytes copied but
      not which specific bytes have been copied.
    </t>

    <t>
      If the optional csr_complete field is present, the copy has
      completed. In this case the status value indicates the result
      of the asynchronous copy operation. In all cases, the server will
      also deliver the final results of the asynchronous copy in a
      CB_COPY operation.
    </t>

    <t>
      The failure of this operation does not indicate the result of
      the asynchronous copy in any way.
    </t>

    <t>
      If the server supports asynchronous copies, the server is
      REQUIRED to support the COPY_STATUS operation.
    </t>

    <t>
      The COPY_STATUS operation may fail for the following reasons
      (this is a partial list):
