  <section toc='exclude' title="DESCRIPTION">
    <t>
      SEEK is an operation that allows a client to determine the location
      of the next data_content4 in a file. It allows an implementation
      of the emerging extension to lseek(2) to allow clients to determine
      the next hole whilst in data or the next data whilst in a hole.
    </t>

    <t>
      From the given sa_offset, find the next data_content4 of type
      sa_what in the file. If the server can not find a corresponding
      sa_what, then the status will still be NFS4_OK, but sr_eof
      would be TRUE.  If the server can find the sa_what, then the
      sr_offset is the start of that content and sr_allocated
      is the space reservation status.
    </t>

    <t>
      SEEK must follow the same rules for stateids as READ_PLUS
      (<xref target='op:read_plus:desc' />).
