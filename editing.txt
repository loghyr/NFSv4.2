1) Any change to the contents of the dotx.d directory require the following targets to be executed:

$ make clean clobber
$ make testx

If it does not pass testx, the changes will not be accepted.

2) Indentation
a) Do not use tabs in any of the .x or .xml files.
b) Do use 2 spaces per level. I.e.,

<section anchor="sec:copy" title="NFS Server-side Copy">
  <section title="Introduction">
    <t>
      This section describes a server-side copy feature for
      the NFS protocol.
    </t>
  </section>
<section>

Even though these files are in essence pulled into other .xml files, do not worry about their indentation in those files.

3) Do not add spaces or tabs at the end of lines.

4) ispell, aspell, spell, whatever, run it on your changes.

5) git, a very short primer

a) Get a copy of the source

$ git clone git@github.com:loghyr/NFSv4.2.git

$ vi ~/.gitconfig

$ cd NFSv4.2

Make your changes.

Confirm your changes do not break anything:

$ make

$ git commit -am "Fixed a minor spelling error"
