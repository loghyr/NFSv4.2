<section anchor='sec:ioadvise' title='Support for Application IO Hints'>
  <t>
    Applications can issue client I/O hints via 
    posix_fadvise() <xref target="posix_fadvise" /> to the NFS client.
    While this can help the NFS
    client optimize I/O and caching for a file, it does not allow the NFS
    server and its exported file system to do likewise. 
    We add an IO_ADVISE procedure (<xref target='op:io_advise' />) to communicate the
    client file access patterns to the NFS server.
    The NFS server upon
    receiving a IO_ADVISE operation MAY choose to alter its I/O and
    caching behavior, but is under no obligation to do so.
  </t>

  <t>
    Application specific NFS clients such as those used by hypervisors
    and databases can also leverage application hints to communicate
    their specialized requirements.
