    <t>
      Applications currently have several options for communicating I/O
      access patterns to the NFS client.  While this can help the NFS
      client optimize I/O and caching for a file, it does not allow the NFS
      server and its exported file system to do likewise. 
      This chapter adds a new IO_ADVISE operation to communicate the
      client file access patterns to the NFS server.  The NFS server upon
      receiving a IO_ADVISE operation MAY choose to alter its I/O and
      caching behavior, but is under no obligation to do so.
    </t>

    <t>
      Applications can issue client I/O hints via the
      posix_fadvise() <xref target="ref:posix_fadvise" /> operation.
      For example, on Linux, when an application
      uses posix_fadvise() to specify a file will be read sequentially, Linux
      doubles the readahead buffer size.
    </t>

    <t>
      Application specific NFS clients such as those used by hypervisors
      and databases can also leverage application hints to communicate
      their specialized requirements.

     The IO_ADVISE_type4 will be extended through an IANA registry.
